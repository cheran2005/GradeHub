## 📌 What is Gradify?

Gradify allows students to easily manage their grades across semesters and courses while gaining insights into what they need to achieve their academic goals.

With Gradify, students can:
- Create **semesters**
- Add **courses** within each semester
- Create **assessments** (tests, assignments, exams, etc.)
- Enter and track **grades**
- Calculate:
  - What grade is needed to **pass a course**
  - What is required to reach a **target GPA**
  - Eligibility for **Dean’s List**
- Visualize grade progress clearly and intuitively

## 🤖 Smart Assessment Creation (Planned Feature)

Gradify will support **automatic assessment creation** by allowing students to:
- Upload an **image** of a course outline or grading breakdown  
- Paste **text** from a syllabus or course document  

The system will intelligently parse this information and **auto-generate assessments with correct weightings**, saving time and reducing manual input.
